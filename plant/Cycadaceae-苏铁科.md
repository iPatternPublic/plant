> **Comment** : 
> One genus and ca. 60 species: E Africa (including Madagascar), E and S Asia, N Australia, Pacific Islands; 16 species (eight endemic) in China.
> Ornamental species include *Cycas revoluta*, which is widely cultivated worldwide. Other species (e.g., *C. circinalis* Linnaeus, *C. media* R. Brown, *C. pectinata*, *C. rumphii* Miquel, *C. taitungensis*, and *C. thouarsii* R. Brown) have excellent ornamental qualities. The stem starch, \"sago\" (not to be confused with the true sago as obtained from palms of the genus *Metroxylon* Rottboøll), is edible and is used in packing brewers’ yeast after the removal of cycasins which are highly toxic and carcinogenic. A paste of *Cycas* seeds and coconut oil is used for the treatment of skin complaints, wounds, ulcers, sores, and boils.

## Description

Trees or shrubs evergreen, dioecious, mostly palmlike; trunk columnar, sometimes dichotomously branched at apex, rarely ovoid-bulbous and subterranean, clothed with bases of fallen leaves; bark often thickened and roughened. Leaves borne at apex of trunk, 1(-3)-pinnately compound, spirally arranged; new leaves erect (or somewhat inflexed and appearing coiled in *C. multipinnata* group), with circinnate leaflets; petiole with spines representing (reduced basal leaflets), rarely unarmed, base swollen and hairy; leaflets numerous, alternate to subopposite, dichotomously branched in a few species, midvein present, margin usually entire. Cataphylls prominent, alternate with leaves, hairy, apex often rigid and pungent. Pollen cones borne at apex of trunk, cylindric or fusiform; microsporophylls numerous, scalelike, spirally and tightly arranged along axis of cone, with numerous microsporangia in groups abaxially; pollen tubes producing 2 motile sperm cells. Megasporophylls several to numerous, somewhat leaflike, alternating with flushes of leaves, arranged in a loose, &amp;quot;conelike&amp;quot; crown surrounding apex of trunk, each with a linear fertile stalk and an apical, pinnatifid or subentire sterile blade; ovules (1 or)2-5 on each side of stalk. Seeds drupelike, somewhat compressed; seed coat 3-layered, consisting of colored sarcotesta, woody sclerotesta, and membranous endotesta. Cotyledons 2, united at base. Germination hypogeal, cryptocotylar. 2*n* = 22*.

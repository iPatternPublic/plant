> **Comment** : 
> A broad concept of *Nageia nagi* is adopted here. However, R. R. Mill indicates that the plants occurring in Taiwan should be treated as two separate species: those from S Taiwan (Hengchun Peninsula area) as *N. formosensis*, and those from N Taiwan (Nanko, Tanshui) as *N. nankoensis*. The taxonomy of this group of taxa is still not fully understood; field observations and cultivation experiments would be desirable.
> The wood is used for constructing houses and bridges, making furniture, utensils, and handicraft articles. The seeds yield an edible oil which is also used in industry.

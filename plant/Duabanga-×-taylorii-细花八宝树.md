> **Comment** : 
> This species is used for timber. It was described from trees cultivated at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. The trees were grown from seed from an unknown source but are suspected to have come from Java. The designation as a hybrid is somewhat uncertain because the two other known species of *Duabanga* do not have overlapping ranges. It might well be a multistaminate form of *D. moluccana* Blume or maybe, if *D. grandiflora* and *D. moluccana* were cultivated together in Java, the seed was from a garden hybrid that occurred there.

A. Simplified diagram of descent in sexually reproducing land plants, in which diploid sporophytes give rise to haploid spores (through meiosis), which develop into haploid gametophytes; the latter produce egg and sperm, fusing to form a diploid zygote, which devel-ops into a diploid sporophyte. B. A lineage, the result of transfer of genetic material over time and space. C. Divergence of one lineage into two, which may result in speciation (illustrated here).
